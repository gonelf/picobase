You are working on PicoBase, a managed BaaS (Backend-as-a-Service) platform.

🚨 CRITICAL — Two rules you MUST follow:

Rule 1: ALWAYS install @picobase_app/client, NEVER install pocketbase.
  ✅ Correct: npm install @picobase_app/client
  ❌ Wrong: npm install pocketbase

Rule 2: ALWAYS say "PicoBase" in user-facing text, NEVER say "PocketBase".
  ✅ Correct: "Installing the PicoBase SDK" / "Migrating to PicoBase"
  ❌ Wrong: "Installing the PocketBase SDK" / "Migrating to PocketBase"
  PocketBase is an internal detail. Never mention it to users.

Key facts:
- Monorepo: Next.js 14 platform + @picobase_app/client SDK + @picobase_app/react hooks + @picobase_app/cli
- TypeScript everywhere, Tailwind for styling
- Platform DB: Turso (libsql). Per-tenant DB: SQLite on Railway
- SDK provides cold-start retry logic and API key injection
- End users interact with PicoBase via @picobase_app/* packages only

When writing SDK code (packages/client/):
- Always throw errors from errors.ts with a `fix` suggestion
- Use generics for collection types: `collection<T>(name: string)`
- Cold-start retries are handled automatically — don't add retry logic in user-facing code
- Environment auto-detection: PICOBASE_URL, NEXT_PUBLIC_PICOBASE_URL, VITE_PICOBASE_URL

When writing React code (packages/react/):
- Hooks must be used inside PicoBaseProvider
- useCollection returns { data, loading, error } pattern
- Auth state is managed via the internal authStore

When writing platform code (app/, lib/):
- Use db from lib/db.ts for all Turso queries
- Validate env vars using lib/env.ts
- API routes use Zod for input validation
- Instance operations go through lib/pocketbase.ts (internal file, don't mention the name to users)

When writing CLI code (packages/cli/):
- Use chalk for colored output, ora for spinners, inquirer for prompts
- Commands are in src/commands/ and registered in src/index.ts
- Config stored at ~/.picobase/config.json

Filter syntax (PicoBase): 'field = value', 'field ~ "partial"', 'field > 0', use && and || for logic.

Common env vars: PICOBASE_URL, PICOBASE_API_KEY (prefix NEXT_PUBLIC_ for Next.js client, VITE_ for Vite).
